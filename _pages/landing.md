__About me__ <br>
My research focuses on adaptation in plant populations, with emphasis on genetic and genomic architecture of adaptive traits. Currently I am a postdoc at the University of Minnesota, studying local adaptation and strctural variant evolution in _Theobroma cacao_. I completed my PhD at the University of Oulu, Finland.

I study adaptation in plant populations, with focus on understanding the genetic and genomic architecture of adaptive traits. Currently I am a postdoc with [Peter Tiffin](http://www.cbs.umn.edu/tiffin/) at University of Minnesota, USA. I completed my PhD with [Outi Savolainen](https://www.oulu.fi/university/researcher/outi-savolainen) at University of Oulu, Finland.

##Structural variant evolution in plants

My ongoing research focuses on understanding how genomic structural variants (SVs) constrain and facilitate adaptation in natural populations. SVs can play important roles in adaptation and speciation, but our understanding of their overall fitness consequences is limited, with data and analyses primarily available for humans and short-lived domesticated species. Using a large collection of long-read-based _de novo_ assemblies of _Theobroma cacao_, I have studied how SVs can both constrain and facilitate adaptation in this tropical tree species.

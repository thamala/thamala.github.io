I study adaptation in plant populations, with emphasis on understanding the genetic and genomic architecture of adaptive traits. Currently I am a postdoc with [Peter Tiffin](http://www.cbs.umn.edu/tiffin/) at University of Minnesota. I completed my PhD with [Outi Savolainen](https://www.oulu.fi/university/researcher/outi-savolainen) at University of Oulu, Finland.

## Structural variant evolution in plants
My ongoing research focuses on understanding how genomic structural variants (SVs) influence evolutionary processes in natural populations. SVs can play important roles in adaptation and speciation, but our understanding of their overall fitness consequences is limited, with data and analyses primarily available for humans and short-lived domesticated species. Using a large collection of long-read-based _de novo_ assemblies of _Theobroma cacao_, I study how insertions, deletions, duplications, and inversions can both constrain and facilitate adaptation in this tropical tree species.

## Genetic architecture of local adaptation
A key determinant of evolutionary responses is the genetic architecture of adaptive traits: i.e., the control of phenotypes by one or many loci, the interactions between alleles (e.g. pleiotropy, epistasis), and positions of loci in relation to genomic features (e.g. recombination rate, gene density).
<br>
During my PhD I studied how gene flow influences the genetic architecture of local adaptation, using closely adjacent population pairs of _Arabidopsis lyrata_ from Norway as my study subject. By reciprocally transpanting local and foreign genotypes, I first examined how local adaptation forms in the face of gene flow ([Hämälä et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13521)). I then utilized whole-genome sequence data, demography analyses, and genome scans for selection to elucidate genomic patterns underlying the adaptive differentiation ([Hämälä & Savolainen](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz149)). Our study is among the first to empirically show that gene flow leads to clusters of adaptive loci in regions of low recombination. We also made a rare effort to distinguish between genetic trade-offs (antagonistic pleiotropy) and conditional neutrality at the level of adaptive loci.

During my current postdoc appointment I have continued to study the genetic architecture of local adaptation.
